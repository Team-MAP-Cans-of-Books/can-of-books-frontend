This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

- #### Mohsin: Want to be able to effectively communicate to the driver technical information.
- #### Peyton: Want to be able to understand the code enough to justify decsions made that affect the code.

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
- #### At the end of every day, we intend on having a designated time to merge onto a single repo, at that time, we intend on clarifying any new code that is added to the main repo if not already discussed beforehand.

## Conflict Resolution
